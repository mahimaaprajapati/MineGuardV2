# MineGuard_model
MineGuard is a real-time, AI-integrated geospatial safety system that ensures miner safety and disaster preparedness. It combines satellite data, remote sensing, predictive analytics, and emergency systems to proactively monitor, analyze, and respond to hazardous mining conditions.
🚀 Key Features
🔍 Real-Time Hazard Prediction
Predicts mine collapses, landslides, and seismic activities using Google Earth Engine, Sentinel-2, Landsat, and historical mining accident data.

🌫️ Air Quality & Weather Monitoring
Uses OpenWeatherMap API to track AQI and weather conditions, identifying gas leaks (like methane or CO) and dust pollution risks in real-time.

📡 Seismic & Earthquake Alerts
Integrated with USGS API to analyze earthquake and seismic activities affecting mining zones.

🆘 Emergency SOS & Rapid Response
One-tap SOS alert system using geolocation to alert nearby rescue teams and suggest immediate AI-powered safety actions.

🧠 AI-Based Health & Risk Assessment
Flask-based backend offers AI health consultation and risk prediction models built with Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, GeoPandas.

📊 Interactive Dashboard
Dynamic React-based web dashboard for live hazard heatmaps, incident reports, and disaster segmentation.

📢 Incident Reporting & Escalation
A secure platform for miners to report safety issues, with automated escalation to higher authorities if ignored.
